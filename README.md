**Take Control of Your Mac Dock**  
The world's first app that prevents your Mac Dock from jumping between screens. Ideal for multi-monitor setups, presentations, and screen sharing â€” with no system modifications.

## Why DockLock Apps Exist
If you use multiple monitors on macOS, youâ€™ve likely experienced the frustration of the Dock jumping to another screen when your cursor touches the bottom edge. Itâ€™s distracting and disruptive, especially during focused work or screen sharing.

**DockLock Apps** solve this by locking the Dock exactly where you want it â€” without hacks, patches, or performance impact.

## Key Features
- Lock the Dock to a specific display
- Prevent Dock jumping across monitors
- Stop Dock pop-ups during screen sharing or meetings
- Allow temporary Dock movement using a key
- Fully sandboxed and secure (uses native macOS Accessibility APIs)

## Versions: DockLock Lite vs DockLock+
Both versions offer the **same full feature set** â€” the difference is in how you pay:

- **DockLock Lite**: Free 7-day trial, then subscription-based.
- **DockLock+**: One-time lifetime purchase.

Choose what fits your preference â€” subscription flexibility or permanent ownership.

## Coming Soon: DockLock Pro
Advanced conditional Dock logic:
- Dynamically move the Dock based on window focus, display changes, hotkeys, or app activity.
- Built for power users.
- Discounted upgrades will be available for DockLock Lite+ and DockLock+ users.
