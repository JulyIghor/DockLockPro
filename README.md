## ⚠️ Important Notes & Limitations

- **Requires at least two monitors** to function.
- **Works only when the Dock is positioned at the bottom** of the screen.
- **The macOS option "Displays have separate Spaces" must be enabled.**
- **Dock Locking is active only while the app is running.**
- **Command+Tab follows the Dock's location** – keeping it on the selected screen.
- **If you hide the menu bar icon, double-clicking the app icon will reopen settings.**

🔹 **Why This Problem Happens:**
Many users move their mouse randomly when searching for the cursor. If the cursor reaches the bottom of an external monitor, macOS mistakenly moves the Dock there. **DockLock Pro prevents this from happening.**
