**Take Control of Your Mac Dock**  
The world's first app that prevents your Mac Dock from jumping between screens. Ideal for multi-monitor setups, presentations, and screen sharing â€” with no system modifications.

## Why DockLock Apps Exist
If you use multiple monitors on macOS, youâ€™ve likely experienced the frustration of the Dock jumping to another screen when your cursor touches the bottom edge. Itâ€™s distracting and disruptive, especially during focused work or screen sharing.

**DockLock Apps** solve this by locking the Dock exactly where you want it â€” without hacks, patches, or performance impact.

## Key Features
- Lock the Dock to a specific display
- Prevent Dock jumping across monitors
- Stop Dock pop-ups during screen sharing or meetings
- Allow temporary Dock movement using a key
- Fully sandboxed and secure (uses native macOS Accessibility APIs)

## Versions: DockLock Lite vs DockLock Plus

DockLock Lite and DockLock Plus now serve different purposes:

- **DockLock Lite**: Offers a 7-day free trial with optional subscription. Focused on reliable Dock locking for multi-monitor setups. Ideal if you only want to stop the Dock from jumping.
- **DockLock Plus**: One-time lifetime purchase. Includes all features of Lite plus powerful automation tools:
  - Dock follows mouse
  - Apple Shortcuts integration
  - URL Scheme support
  - Menu actions to move Dock to named screens
  - Third-party automation compatibility

DockLock Plus is for users who want more control and integration. DockLock Lite remains a great choice for basic, stable Dock locking.

## Coming Soon: DockLock Pro
Advanced conditional Dock logic:
- Dynamically move the Dock based on window focus, display changes, hotkeys, or app activity.
- Built for power users.
- Discounted upgrades will be available for DockLock Lite and DockLock Plus users.
